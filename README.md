Frameless
=========

Frameless is a web browser for iOS 8+ that gets out of your way. It was built for designers and prototypers who need to interact with your prototypes in a "native" device environment but also works to browser most websites.

Framer Studio Users
-------------------

I highly recommend downloading and using [the official Framer viewer app for iOS](http://blog.framerjs.com/posts/framer-preview-for-ios.html). It's got a more robust feature set than Frameless and is actively maintained by the Framer team.

Frameless is currently unsupported: I haven't been actively maintaining or fixing issues with Frameless since late 2015. 

You can still download the most recent release of Frameless (October 15, 2015) to your iPhone [from the iOS App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id933580264).
